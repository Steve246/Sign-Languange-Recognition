Part of my Final Year Project, It still in process, but you can used recognize sign languange 

1. OpenCV File can be used to recognize sign languange gesture ( Warning! --> Only can be used, if you run it in Jupyter Notebook)
2. File with no OpenCV attach, only explored the dataset. I trained it to gained the confusion matrix of the trained dataset
